    News('images/RIGHT_OF_ADMISSION.jpg','Right of admission reserved for the less fortunate in this TN school\nWhile being in the process though, there is something so innate that makes them capable of, maybe yet unaware of it. It‚Äôs called privilege.\nBy P Thiruselvam\nExpress News Service\nARIYALUR: Ever wondered what drives forward a kid caught in the race that education has turned into, these days? It might well be the competitive, demanding aspect of it which always propels them to widen their arms and get hold of every bit of knowledge out there. While being in the process though, there is something so innate that makes them capable of, maybe yet unaware of it. It‚Äôs called privilege.\nFor many like the 67 Irular children in Ariyalur‚Äôs Olaiyur and Pappankulam villages, however, there is no such air hovering over their heads. Left to sweat it out in a race of unequals, they need an extra push to dive deep into the vast knowledge pool where others are soaked in. That is exactly what D Elavarasan, a 32-year-old teacher, is giving them with his classes and care.\nElavarasan, who works in a private school, has been taking evening classes to these children every day except Sundays for the last five years. Children from classes 1 to 11 attend the classes, which Elavarsan has called ‚ÄòMahatma Gandhi Malai Nera Padippagam‚Äô. Apart from teaching them basic subject lessons, special attention is given to their skill development. They are also provided with notebooks, pens, books, school uniforms and are given a nutritious meal thrice a week.\nOther than coordinating the classes, he anchors a collective called ‚ÄòSweet Trust‚Äô, which was formed six years ago in view of the drought in the district. The group has so far planted three lakh palm seeds and one lakh other saplings around lakes, ponds, and near roadsides in the district. More than hundreds of youths and college students from various villages have joined him in the efforts for the last five years.\nThe man‚Äôs efforts for holding the classes daily are aided by the NGO -- Networking and Development Centre for Service Organisation (NDCSO), which gives him necessary funding. The NGO also helps students who have completed their schooling to pursue higher education. He is helped by graduates from the village who are assigned to monitor the classes.\nSpeaking to TNIE, Elavarasan said, ‚ÄúMost of the people here do not have basic education. Some do not even send their children to school but instead take them to work. We wanted to improve the lives of the Irular children.‚Äù\nHe said they are now going to focus on teaching Irular students across the district. Providing them with basic education will help the whole community come forward and benefit their next generations, he added.\nAccording to the NGO‚Äôs founder J Prabhakar, the floods of 2015 were the starting point of the programme. ‚ÄúWhen the floods hit Cuddalore, the Irular community was severely affected. Even though we helped them, we found out that they were backward in education. Many students have so far benefited from this.‚Äù\nV Kanagavalli, who studies in class 11 in a government higher secondary school in Keezha Kolathur, said the classes helped clear her doubts. The gratitude for having gotten a push to run in a marathon race for knowledge and better lives was palpable in her soft yet gritty response.\nhttps://www.newindianexpress.com/good-news/2021/dec/05/right-of-admission-reserved-for-the-less-fortunate-in-this-tn-school-2391968.html'),

Those who realize the True Lord, they alone are the true kings.
Today is the Gurgaddi Diwas of the Tenth Master of Sikhs Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji. 
Guru Gobind Singh Ji was born as Gobind Rai in the house of Ninth Master Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji and Mata Gujri Ji in Patna in 1666.
Under Aurangzeb\'s orders, Kashmiri Brahmins were being forcibly converted to Islam. Flocks of Kashmiri Brahmins, led by Pandit Kirpa Ram, rushed to Anandpur and pleaded their case before Guru Ji: "O Divine Master! Help us save our Hindu Dharma, so that we may keep our frontal mark (Tilak) and sacred thread (Janeu) intact. A reign of terror has been let loose upon us by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb to shed our articles of faith and embrace Islam." Hearing their petition, Guru Ji was moved and attuned Himself with the Divine within. The atmosphere became very holy, serene, and pious. The nine-year-old Gobind Rai asked his father, "What do these holy men want? How can these terrified people be saved from the tyranny of Aurangzeb?" Guru Ji told his son that this would be possible only if a Divine person sacrificed his life to protect their Dharma. Gobind Rai submitted with folded hands "O Divine father! Who is greater than You in the Divine Realm?‚Äù Hearing the divine words from His young son, Guru Ji pacified and assured the Kashmiri Pandits that their Dharma would be saved by making a great sacrifice. He told them that they should convey to Aurangzeb that if he could succeed in converting Guru Tegh Bahadur to Islam, all Brahmins would then embrace Islam automatically. 
For this divine cause of saving the Hindu Dharma, Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji left for Delhi where he and his companions refused to embrace Islam and attained martyrdom.
During this period according to the instructions of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, Gobind Rai was bestowed with the Guruship by the holy congregation. Baba Ram Kanwar, a direct descendant of Baba Buddha Ji, put the frontal mark on his forehead, and a plume (Kalgi) on his turban. Thus, the nine-year-old Gobind Rai was anointed as the tenth Guru Nanak.

Toilets were constructed after The New Indian Express had highlighted the needs of the school on September 19 and raised the question of whether the funds would reach the cause.

VIRUDHUNAGAR: In less than two months after Collector J Meghanatha Reddy passed the proceedings for the construction of two disabled-friendly toilets, the funds have found its way for the same. Collector opened two disabled-friendly toilets under the \'Udhayam\' scheme in the CSI school for Elwin Centre in Sivakasi for use on the occasion of World Disability Day here on Friday.

Toilets were constructed after The New Indian Express had highlighted the needs of the school on September 19 and raised the question of whether the funds would reach the cause. It looks like the universe has indeed conspired in helping them in achieving their needs.

Speaking at the inauguration event, the collector said though he was exposed to the issues of Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) through his friends, difficulty in using a toilet did not come into his thought up until it a 16-year-old girl in a pension camp at the collectorate raised it.

"Normally toilets at our houses would be small and cannot be easily accessed by PwDs. After the girl explained their plight, I wanted to do something about this, and we devised the \'Udhayam\' scheme. Though we will not be able to construct toilets for everyone immediately, we are doing it in a phased manner based on CSR funds and other fund availability, prioritising women and girls," he said.  

He further said under the initiative it has been aimed to build at least 100 toilets by the end of this year. Speaking about the need of the school, he said that when the school approached him, though there was no fund at hand, he had made arrangements from his discretionary funds.

The funds for two other toilets under construction is sponsored by a private sponsor, he added. Stating a saying, he said, "When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it, and I wanted to do this for the differently-abled people. I got in touch with the like-minded people who supported me in taking the project forward," he said.

School correspondent M Dayalan Barnabas demanded three things during the function: a paver block road leading to the school; include the widowed women in the school in the scheme where free goats are distributed by the state government and include Elwin Centre in \'Adult Project\' under the PwD welfare department as nearly 50 adult PwDs are residing in the school. Collecter assured to take action.

Backstory

The Elwin Centre, located in Sivakasi\'s Satchiyapuram was established in 1980 by Selvabai and her husband Reverend Thavaraj David. The school is now working under the model of self-sustenance with limited funding. The school aims to translate its financial model into the lives of its children. As part of the self-sustenance project, they bought 50 country chickens and reared them. "Everything, from feeding the chicken to cleaning the coops, was done by our children. The money coming from the rearing is re-invested in similar ventures.

During the earlier interaction with The New Indian Express, they had highlighted two issues: a crunch in funds despite the self-sustenance model and well-wishers; and the lack of disability-friendly toilets for the children who also have physical disabilities.

When the latter issue was highlighted to the collector, he had immediately conducted inspections, following which Rs 94,000 was sanctioned in the first phase for the construction of two toilets and mobilised funds through private sponsor for the construction of another two.

Earlier, the district officials, led by the collector, created a project named Udhayam to build accessible toilets in their houses for PwDs, in the district.

News('images/LOVING_LIBRARY.jpg','‚ÄòLoving Library‚Äô by a Little Singh for Covid Patients

A 9-year-old Little Singh, Anaik Singh from Phoenix, Arizona, U.S.A. has created a Free Library for the Covid-19 Patients named "Loving Library".

Recently he shared his story on the Famous Ellen Show about how he thought of starting such a kind of library. He shared how his family suffered from Covid-19, and his grandmother was hospitalized. When his family was in isolation, he was all alone and then he found his own escape and jumped into the world of books.

He also added, "When my family recovered, I started thinking about ways to help other people. That\'s where my experience with books accompanying me through isolation came in handy. I decided to create a "Loving Library" for the hospital patients going through quarantine from the virus."

The project started with isolated people who suffered from COVID and is now helping the homeless. A donation book program is being run this year for hospitalized COVID patients in underserved communities and homeless patients at the \'Circle the City,\' a medical clinic for those who are homeless.

The ‚ÄòLoving Library‚Äô aims to add a thousand books to its collection this year.

The Little Singh hopes to provide a variety of genres, including fiction, non-fiction, mystery, books in languages such as Spanish, journals, and more.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/BaruSahibHP/photos/a.312356885474161/4744653975577741/'),
